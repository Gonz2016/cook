# cookie-store

Added a second store information to the cookie project.
added the rest of the stores having major problems with the spelling of the
words, and having code rejections.

Overall a nice project.  But I need more practice.  

Linked a stylesheet for the improvement this project, and made another
commit for project # 7.

Created a styleguide to complete project # 7.  

Created a table with the different stores sites, with html, javascript, and css files.  Project # 8 completed and sent the repository.
